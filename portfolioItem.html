                    Re:Legend is a monster raising focused JRPG with features such as farming, fishing, crafting, village building, multiplayer and more                </div>

                    When I first joined the project, even though on the surface there were some core systems in
                    place, but the code base is not not scale-able. Therefore, basically we have to rework the
                    entire game.

                    As a programmer, I work with an interdisciplinary team of artists, designers and programmers to
                    design, prototype and implement new features and rework current features.

                    I have also worked well under pressure with constant reiteration of features.
